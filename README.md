# Philosopher Project

## Overview

The **Philosopher Project** simulates the classic dining philosophers' problem, where philosophers alternate between
eating, thinking, and sleeping. This project focuses on the importance of understanding **threads** and **mutexes** to prevent **data races**
and ensure a synchronized and efficient solution. It is a practical exercise in concurrency and synchronization in C programming.

## Features

1. **Thread-Based Implementation**:
   - Each philosopher is represented as a thread.
   - Threads handle simultaneous operations, showcasing the challenges of concurrent programming.

2. **Forks and Mutexes**:
   - Each fork is represented by a mutex, preventing multiple philosophers from using the same fork simultaneously.
   - Proper use of mutexes ensures no **data races** occur.

3. **Simulation Rules**:
   - Philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping.
   - A philosopher must hold two forks (left and right) to eat.
   - The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation or when all philosophers have eaten a specified number of times.

4. **Logging**:
   - All philosopher state changes are logged with timestamps for debugging and validation.
   - State messages include:
     - Taking a fork
     - Eating
     - Sleeping
     - Thinking
     - Dying (with a delay of no more than 10 ms from the actual death)

## Requirements

### General
- The project must be written in **C** and follow the **Norm**.
- All memory must be freed properly, and no memory leaks are allowed.
- The program must avoid crashes (e.g., segmentation faults, double frees).
- A `Makefile` must compile the project with flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` and include rules for `NAME`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, and `re`.

## Program Arguments
The program takes the following arguments:

1. `number_of_philosophers`: The number of philosophers and forks at the table.
2. `time_to_die` (in milliseconds): If a philosopher does not start eating within `time_to_die` milliseconds since their last meal or the start of the simulation, they die.
3. `time_to_eat` (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During this time, they must hold two forks.
4. `time_to_sleep` (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher spends sleeping.
5. `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]` (optional): If specified, the simulation stops when all philosophers have eaten at least this many times.
		If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

## Philosopher Behavior
- Philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping.
- A philosopher requires two forks (one on the left and one on the right) to eat.
- After eating, they return the forks and begin sleeping.
- Once awake, they resume thinking.
- The simulation stops when a philosopher dies from starvation.

## Simulation Rules
- Each philosopher is represented by a thread.
- Fork states are protected using mutexes to prevent duplication and ensure thread safety.
- Global variables are forbidden.
- Logs must be formatted as follows:
  - `timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork`
  - `timestamp_in_ms X is eating`
  - `timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping`
  - `timestamp_in_ms X is thinking`
  - `timestamp_in_ms X died`
  - Replace `timestamp_in_ms` with the current timestamp in milliseconds and `X` with the philosopher number.

## Bonus Part
The bonus part introduces the following changes:
- Philosophers are represented as processes instead of threads.
- Forks are managed using a semaphore to represent the number of available forks.
- The main process oversees the philosophers but is not a philosopher itself.

Note: The bonus part will only be evaluated if the mandatory part is completed perfectly.
